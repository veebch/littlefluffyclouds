# little fluffy clouds

Supporting materials for making a happy cloud (formally known as Cheeky Sue), shown in the video below. 

It's done using some (really thin) nichrome wire and a battery. When power is applied the wire acts as a resistor, the resistance generates heat and the wire will then easily cut the polystyrene.

The shape is 4 simple arcs. Once it is cut, make a template for the face using the template image (cheekysue.svg) file in this repository and dab some paint through. 

## Template Image

Here is is as a vector file.

## Disclaimer

The mechanism for heating up the wire needs to be done properly. Buy a commercially available device or research on how to do it safely. Wear safety glasses etc.
